# Flappy

Update and personal transformation of [TheCherno's](https://github.com/TheCherno) LWJGL3 flappy bird. Updated to work on the latest nightly version of LWJGL3 (as of 1/15/2016) and has some improvement in gameplay, memory usage, and stability (oh and I added some sounds too).

### Dependencies
* `LWJGL 3` : Light Weight Java Game Library 3, which you can download [here](http://www.lwjgl.org/download). You'll have to manually add the JAR and native files to your classpath in order to build and run the game.
